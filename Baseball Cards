In this example I have created a small Baseball card data base where I am updating and delete informaton for certain players. 

Create Table Baseball_Cards (
    Id Integer Primary Key Autoincrement,
    Fullname TEXT,
    Rookie_Year INTEGER,
    Card_Value INTEGER);
    
    
Insert into Baseball_cards (Fullname, Rookie_Year, Card_Value) 
Values ('Bobby Witt Jr', 2022, 500);
Insert into Baseball_cards (Fullname, Rookie_Year, Card_Value) 
Values ('Julio Rodriguez', 2022, 700);
Insert into Baseball_cards (Fullname, Rookie_Year, Card_Value) 
Values ('Mickey Mantle', 1952, 15000000);
    

Select * FROM Baseball_Cards;

Update Baseball_Cards set Card_Value = 1500 where id = 3;

Select * FROM Baseball_Cards;

Delete from Baseball_Cards where id = 2;

Select * FROM Baseball_Cards;
